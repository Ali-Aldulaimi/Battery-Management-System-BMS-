build a Battery management system from a scratch with the following specification :

BMS contain 4 cells, 3V each or something equivalent 
Voltage and current monitoring for each cell 
charging and discharging process (SOC)
overall health of the battery (SOH)
Mosfet driven switch (both charging and discharging)
Communication of cell voltages over Modbus RTU
STM32 controller with over/under voltage per cell, over/under temperature (charge: 0C to 40C and discharge: -20C to 40C).
some kind of visualization of the modbus data (ex .Grafana)
